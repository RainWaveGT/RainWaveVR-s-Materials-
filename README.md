# RainWaveVR-s-Materials-

**THESE COSMETCIS DO NOT WORK ANYMORE!! The mod that these cosmetics were made for is discontinued and is no longer usable due to a recent Gorilla Tag update which had changed the unity version, breaking ALL unity asset bundles, including Custom Cosmeticss.**

This repository will feature my Materials i made for the popular VR game **Gorilla Tag**.
# How do I install these custom materials?
Gorilla Tag does NOT come with any Material changing abilities, you need to download 2 Mods for this to work
# Banana OS by husky
# CustomCosmetics by Wryser
**Note, These mods & Materials only work for the PCVR edition of Gorilla Tag, as Mods for the quest edition of Gorilla Tag do NOT exist.**
